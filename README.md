# Invisble-red-cloak

    This repositor containes code for the  ‘Invisibile Red Cloak’ using OpenCV Library in Python. 

    Here the code is written to generate invisivle cloak-like effects for red colored cloak. if you have some other
    color like blue or green, they can also be adapted by modifying values of upper and lower bpound of that color 
    to produce masking.

    I have extensively using OpenCV library to perform this task. Specifically, we have leveraged bitwise operations 
    on images, morphological operations, video caputiring ability and 'inRange' operation to produce masking. 


    Note: Make sure your background image directory is correct and that background cloth is same as cloak cloth.
  
 
# Future Scope
  
    I am planning to work on this repository in more depth so as to create a model which can detect background color 
    by itself using clustering segmentation so as to make it more robust and practical
